# Bust-Project

The objective of this project is to use data analytics and visualization tools (R with Shiny and ggplot) to find the rate and instances of busts in the first four rounds of the NFL Draft from the years 1998-2015. 
Data collected from official resources was used for regressions and trend analysis to find busts.
